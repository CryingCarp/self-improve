      "1. **Departure Times**: The code first checks the scheduled departure times from Fisherman's Cove.\n",
      "2. **Sequential Journey**: It then follows the scheduled boat times through each stop to ensure Linda can board each subsequent boat based on the arrival times.\n",
      "3. **Validation**: The code checks if Linda can make each connection based on the arrival time at the previous stop.\n",
      "4. **Final Output**: Finally, it outputs the correct arrival time at Palm Tree Island or a message indicating if any connection is not feasible.\n",
