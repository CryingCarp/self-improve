They evolved from Arthur Bowley's work in the early 1900s, and are useful tools in exploratory data analysis. Stemplots became more commonly used in the 1980s after the publication of John Tukey's book on exploratory data analysis in 1977. The popularity during those years is attributable to their use of monospaced (typewriter) typestyles that allowed computer technology of the time to easily produce the graphics. Modern computers' superior graphic capabilities have meant these techniques are less often used.\nThis plot has been implemented in Octave and R.\nA stem-and-leaf plot is also called a stemplot, but the latter term often refers to another chart type.  A simple stem plot may refer to plotting a matrix of y values onto a common x axis, and identifying the common x value with a vertical line, and the individual y values with symbols on the line.\nUnlike histograms, stem-and-leaf displays retain the original data to at least two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and non-parametric statistics.\n\nPage: Exploratory data analysis\nSummary: In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts with traditional hypothesis testing, in which a model is supposed to be selected before the data is seen. Exploratory data analysis has been promoted by John Tukey since 1970 to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.\n\n\n\nPage: Plot (graphics)\nSummary: A plot is a graphical technique for representing a data set, usually as a graph showing the relationship between two or more variables. The plot can be drawn by hand or by a computer. In the past, sometimes mechanical or electronic plotters were used. Graphs are a visual representation of the relationship between variables, which are very useful for humans who can then quickly derive an understanding which may not have come from lists of values. Given a scale or ruler, graphs can also be used to read off the value of an unknown variable plotted as a function of a known one, but this can also be done with data presented in tabular form. Graphs of functions are used in mathematics, sciences, engineering, technology, finance, and other areas."]]}, {"step": " Understand that the stem represents the tens place and the leaf represents the units place of the square meters measurement.

Skyline Drive is the main park road, generally traversing along the ridgeline of the mountains. Almost 40% of the park's land\u201479,579 acres (124 sq mi; 322 km2)\u2014has been designated as wilderness areas and is protected as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

The park includes popular attractions such as the Los Angeles Zoo, the Autry Museum of the American West, the Griffith Observatory, and the Hollywood Sign. Due to its appearance in many films, the park is among the most famous municipal parks in North America.\nIt has been compared to Central Park in New York City and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, but it is much larger, less tamed, and more rugged than either of those parks. The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission adopted the characterization of the park as an \"urban wilderness\" on January 8, 2014. The park covers 4,310 acres (1,740 ha) of land, making it one of the largest urban parks in North America.

Most are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing tickets.\nThe film is projected with a movie projector onto a large projection screen at the front of the auditorium while the dialogue, sounds and music are played through a number of wall-mounted speakers. Since the 1970s, subwoofers have been used for low-pitched sounds. Since the 2010s, the majority of movie theaters have been equipped for digital cinema projection, removing the need to create and transport a physical film print on a heavy reel.\nA great variety of films are shown at cinemas, ranging from animated films to blockbusters to documentaries. The smallest movie theaters have a single viewing room with a single screen. In the 2010s, most movie theaters had multiple screens. The largest theater complexes, which are called multiplexes\u2014a concept developed in Canada in the 1950s\u2014have up to thirty screens. The audience members often sit on padded seats, which in most theaters are set on a sloped floor, with the highest part at the rear of the theater.

The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.\nFunctions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a planet is a function of time. Historically, the concept was elaborated with the infinitesimal calculus at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were differentiable (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory, and this greatly increased the possible applications of the concept.\nA function is often denoted by a letter such as f, g or h. The value of a function f at an element x of its domain (that is, the element of the codomain that is associated with x) is denoted by f(x); for example, the value of f at x = 4 is denoted by f(4). Commonly, a specific function is defined by means of an expression depending on x, such as \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+1;}\n  \n in this case, some computation, called function evaluation, may be needed for deducing the value of the function at a particular value; for example, if \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+1,}\n  \n then \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        4\n        )\n        =\n        \n          4\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        =\n        17.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(4)=4^{2}+1=17.}\n  \n\nGiven its domain and its codomain, a function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs (x, f\u200a(x)), called the graph of the function, a popular means of illustrating the function. When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane.\nFunctions are widely used in science, engineering, and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are \"the central objects of investigation\" in most fields of mathematics.\nThe concept of a function has evolved significantly over centuries, from its informal origins in ancient mathematics to its formalization in the 19th century. See History of the function concept for details.\n\n\n\nPage: Continuous function\nSummary: In mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a small variation of the argument induces a small variation of the value of the function. This implies there are no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is not continuous. Until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity and considered only continuous functions. The epsilon\u2013delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.\nContinuity is one of the core concepts of calculus and mathematical analysis, where arguments and values of functions are real and complex numbers. The concept has been generalized to functions between metric spaces and between topological spaces. The latter are the most general continuous functions, and their definition is the basis of topology.\nA stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In order theory, especially in domain theory, a related concept of continuity is Scott continuity.\nAs an example, the function H(t) denoting the height of a growing flower at time t would be considered continuous. In contrast, the function M(t) denoting the amount of money in a bank account at time t would be considered discontinuous since it \"jumps\" at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn.\n\nPage: Domain of a function\nSummary: In mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of inputs accepted by the function. It is sometimes denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        dom\n        \u2061\n        (\n        f\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {dom} (f)}\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        dom\n        \u2061\n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {dom} f}\n  \n, where f is the function. In layman's terms, the domain of a function can generally be thought of as \"what x can be\".\nMore precisely, given a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        X\n        \u2192\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\colon X\\to Y}\n  \n, the domain of f is X. In modern mathematical language, the domain is part of the definition of a function rather than a property of it.\nIn the special case that X and Y are both sets of real numbers, the function f can be graphed in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this case, the domain is represented on the x-axis of the graph, as the projection of the graph of the function onto the x-axis.\nFor a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        X\n        \u2192\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\colon X\\to Y}\n  \n, the set Y is called the codomain: the set to which all outputs must belong. The set of specific outputs the function assigns to elements of X is called its range or image. The image of f is a subset of Y, shown as the yellow oval in the accompanying diagram.\nAny function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The restriction of \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        X\n        \u2192\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\colon X\\to Y}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \u2286\n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\subseteq X}\n  \n, is written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            f\n            |\n          \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left.f\\right|_{A}\\colon A\\to Y}\n  \n."]]}, {"step": " Identify the unique x values in the provided table: 3, 19, 19, 13.

The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are both equally probable; the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).\nThese concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems.\n\n\n\nPage: Bayesian probability\nSummary: Bayesian probability ( BAY-zee-\u0259n or  BAY-zh\u0259n) is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.\nThe Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses; that is, with propositions whose truth or falsity is unknown. In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under frequentist inference, a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability.\nBayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies a prior probability. This, in turn, is then updated to a posterior probability in the light of new, relevant data (evidence). The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.\nThe term Bayesian derives from the 18th-century mathematician and theologian Thomas Bayes, who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as Bayesian inference.:\u200a131\u200a Mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace pioneered and popularized what is now called Bayesian probability.:\u200a97\u201398\u200a\n\n\n\nPage: Probability distribution\nSummary: In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).\nFor instance, if X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (\"the experiment\"), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 (1 in 2 or 1/2) for X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails (assuming that the coin is fair). More commonly, probability distributions are used to compare the relative occurrence of many different random values.\nProbability distributions can be defined in different ways and for discrete or for continuous variables. Distributions with special properties or for especially important applications are given specific names.\n\n"]]}], "tool_execution_list": [], "prediction": "5/17"}

It is most commonly used in public transport, but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership. Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with  double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. Coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving license.\nBuses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles.\nHorse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895. Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel. As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world.\n\nPage: Coach USA\nSummary: Coach USA, LLC is a holding company for various American transportation service providers providing scheduled intercity bus service, local and commuter bus transit, city sightseeing, tour, yellow school bus, and charter bus service across the United States and Canada. It is owned by the private equity firm, Variant Equity Advisors, based in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nPage: Best of Both Worlds Tour\nSummary: Best of Both Worlds Tour was the debut concert tour by American singer Miley Cyrus. The tour was held in support of the double-disc Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), which consisted of the soundtrack to Hannah Montana's second season and her debut studio album. It initiated in October 2007 and concluded in January 2008, visiting cities in the United States and Canada. The tour was promoted by AEG Live and Buena Vista Concerts. Labelmates the Jonas Brothers, Aly & AJ, and Everlife each served as opening act during the tour. One dollar from each ticket sold was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, an organization devoted to the fight against cancer. The Best of Both Worlds Tour raised over US $2 million for the organization.\nThe Best of Both Worlds Tour was created by Kenny Ortega and Michael Cotten to be video intensive and was meant to differentiate Cyrus from Hannah Montana as a performer. The show had Cyrus performing first under character, as Hannah Montana. She then performed a duet with the opening act, which continued performing an interlude of songs. For the latter half of the duet, a body double was used to facilitate the transition from Hannah Montana to herself. Videos online caused many fans to become outraged and question whether Cyrus lip-synched on the tour. Her representatives later issued a statement that denied the allegations and stated the reasons for the body double's usage. The fast-paced concert had six segments, divided equally between each persona.\nThe tour received generally positive responses from critics, some who complimented Cyrus' vocal skills and onstage presence and preferred the Hannah Montana set over Cyrus'. The tour was commercially successful, grossing over $54 million.

The city lies at the heart of the wider City of Winchester, a local government district, at the western end of the South Downs National Park, on the River Itchen. It is 60 miles (97 km) south-west of London and 14 miles (23 km) from Southampton, its nearest city. At the 2021 census, the built-up area of Winchester had a population of 48,478. The wider City of Winchester district includes towns such as Alresford and Bishop's Waltham and had a population of 127,439 in 2021. Winchester is the county town of Hampshire and contains the head offices of Hampshire County Council.\nWinchester developed from the Roman town of Venta Belgarum, which in turn developed from an Iron Age oppidum. Winchester was one of the most important cities in England until the Norman conquest in the eleventh century. It has since become one of the most expensive and affluent areas in the United Kingdom.\nThe city's major landmark is Winchester Cathedral. The city is also home to the University of Winchester and Winchester College, the oldest public school in the United Kingdom still using its original buildings.\n\nPage: Public transport timetable\nSummary: A public transport timetable  (also timetable and North American English schedule) is a document setting out information on public transport service times. Both public timetables to assist passengers with planning a trip and internal timetables to inform employees exist. Typically, the timetable will list the times when a service is scheduled to arrive at and depart from specified locations. It may show all movements at a particular location or all movements on a particular route or for a particular stop. Traditionally this information was provided in printed form, for example as a leaflet or poster. It is now also often available in a variety of electronic formats.\nIn the 2000s, public transport route planners / intermodal journey planners have proliferated and offer traveller the convenience that the computer program looks at all timetables so the traveller doesn't need to.\nA \"timetable\" may also refer to the same information in abstract form, not specifically published, e.g. \"A new timetable has been introduced\".\n\nPage: Winchester Highlands station\nSummary: Winchester Highlands station was an MBTA Commuter Rail Lowell Line station located at Cross Street in the northern part of Winchester, Massachusetts. It originally opened in the mid-19th century under the Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&L) as a flag stop called North Winchester. In 1877, a local real estate developer constructed a new station building, which was renamed Winchester Highlands. The B&L became part of the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M) in 1887. Service to the station gradually decreased in the 20th century, and the depot was replaced by a wooden shelter around 1943. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing service on the line in 1965. Winchester Highlands and two other stations with low ridership were closed by the MBTA in June 1978."]]}, {"step": " Select the departure time from the options provided: ['8:55 P.M.', '5:05 P.M.', '5:25 P.M.', '3:30 P.M.'].

The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.\nFunctions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a planet is a function of time. Historically, the concept was elaborated with the infinitesimal calculus at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were differentiable (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory, and this greatly increased the possible applications of the concept.\nA function is often denoted by a letter such as f, g or h. The value of a function f at an element x of its domain (that is, the element of the codomain that is associated with x) is denoted by f(x); for example, the value of f at x = 4 is denoted by f(4). Commonly, a specific function is defined by means of an expression depending on x, such as \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+1;}\n  \n in this case, some computation, called function evaluation, may be needed for deducing the value of the function at a particular value; for example, if \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+1,}\n  \n then \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        4\n        )\n        =\n        \n          4\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        =\n        17.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(4)=4^{2}+1=17.}\n  \n\nGiven its domain and its codomain, a function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs (x, f\u200a(x)), called the graph of the function, a popular means of illustrating the function. When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane.\nFunctions are widely used in science, engineering, and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are \"the central objects of investigation\" in most fields of mathematics.\nThe concept of a function has evolved significantly over centuries, from its informal origins in ancient mathematics to its formalization in the 19th century. See History of the function concept for details.\n\n\n\nPage: Function\nSummary: Function or functionality may refer to:\n\n\n\nPage: List of mathematical functions\nSummary: In mathematics, some functions or groups of functions are important enough to deserve their own names. This is a listing of articles which explain some of these functions in more detail. There is a large theory of special functions which developed out of statistics and mathematical physics. A modern, abstract point of view contrasts large function spaces, which are infinite-dimensional and within which most functions are 'anonymous', with special functions picked out by properties such as symmetry, or relationship to harmonic analysis and group representations.\nSee also List of types of functions\n\n"]]}, {"step": " Examine the provided table and list the unique x-values and their corresponding y-values.

The pickling procedure typically affects the food's texture and flavor. The resulting food is called a pickle, or, if named, the name is prefaced with the word \"pickled\". Foods that are pickled include vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, meats, fish, dairy and eggs.\nPickling solutions are typically highly acidic, with a pH of 4.6 or lower, and high in salt, preventing enzymes from working and micro-organisms from multiplying. Pickling can preserve perishable foods for months, or in some cases years. Antimicrobial herbs and spices, such as mustard seed, garlic, cinnamon or cloves, are often added. If the food contains sufficient moisture, a pickling brine may be produced simply by adding dry salt. For example, sauerkraut and Korean kimchi are produced by salting the vegetables to draw out excess water. Natural fermentation at room temperature, by lactic acid bacteria, produces the required acidity. Other pickles are made by placing vegetables in vinegar. Like the canning process, pickling (which includes fermentation) does not require that the food be completely sterile before it is sealed. The acidity or salinity of the solution, the temperature of fermentation, and the exclusion of oxygen determine which microorganisms dominate, and determine the flavor of the end product.\nWhen both salt concentration and temperature are low, Leuconostoc mesenteroides dominates, producing a mix of acids, alcohol, and aroma compounds. At higher temperatures Lactobacillus plantarum dominates, which produces primarily lactic acid. Many pickles start with Leuconostoc, and change to Lactobacillus with higher acidity.\n\nPage: Pull-tab\nSummary: A pull-tab is a gambling ticket for a pull-tab game. Other names for the game include Break-Opens, Nevada Tickets, Cherry Bells, Lucky 7s, Pickle Cards, Pickle Tickets, Instant Bingo, Bowl Games, or Popp-Opens.\nPhysical pull-tab tickets are multi-layered paper tickets containing symbols hidden behind perforated tabs. The player opens the perforated windows on the ticket to reveal a winning combination. The player turns in the winning ticket for a prize. Electronic analogues have also been created.\n\nPage: List of Chopped episodes (season 41\u2013present)\nSummary: This is the list of episodes for the Food Network competition reality series Chopped, beginning with season 41.

The clarinet family is the largest woodwind family, ranging from the BB\u266d contrabass to the E\u266d soprano. The B\u266d soprano clarinet is the most common type, and is the instrument usually indicated by the word \"clarinet\".\nGerman instrument maker Johann Christoph Denner is generally credited with inventing the clarinet sometime around 1700 by adding a register key to the chalumeau, an earlier single-reed instrument. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability. Today the clarinet is a standard fixture of the orchestra and concert band and is used in classical music, military bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles.\n\nPage: Clarinet family\nSummary: The clarinet family is a woodwind instrument family of various sizes and types of clarinets, including the common soprano clarinet in B\u266d and A, bass clarinet, and sopranino E\u266d clarinet.\nClarinets that aren't the standard B\u266d or A clarinets are sometimes known as harmony clarinets. There are many differently pitched clarinet types that may be grouped into sub-families, but grouping and terminology vary; the list below reflects popular usage.\n\nPage: Bass clarinet\nSummary: The bass clarinet is a musical instrument of the clarinet family. Like the more common soprano B\u266d clarinet, it is usually pitched in B\u266d (meaning it is a transposing instrument on which a written C sounds as B\u266d), but it plays notes an octave below the soprano B\u266d clarinet. Bass clarinets in other keys, notably C and A, also exist, but are very rare (in contrast to the regular A clarinet, which is quite common in classical music). Bass clarinets regularly perform in orchestras, wind ensembles and concert bands, and occasionally in marching bands, and play an occasional solo role in contemporary music and jazz in particular.\nSomeone who plays a bass clarinet is called a bass clarinettist or a bass clarinetist."]]}], "tool_execution_list": [], "prediction": "clarinet"}

Within this spectrum is applied research, or translational research, conducted to expand knowledge in the field of medicine.\nBoth clinical and preclinical research phases exist in the pharmaceutical industry's drug development pipelines, where the clinical phase is denoted by the term clinical trial. However, only part of the clinical or preclinical research is oriented towards a specific pharmaceutical purpose. The need for fundamental and mechanism-based understanding, diagnostics, medical devices, and non-pharmaceutical therapies means that pharmaceutical research is only a small part of medical research.\nMost of the research in the field is pursued by biomedical scientists, but significant contributions are made by other type of biologists. Medical research on humans has to strictly follow the medical ethics sanctioned in the Declaration of Helsinki and the institutional review board where the research is conducted. In all cases, research ethics are expected.\n\n\n\nPage: Medical Research Council\nSummary: Medical Research Council may refer to:\n\nMedical Research Council (Ireland), forerunner of the Health Research Board\nMedical Research Council (United Kingdom), responsible for coordinating and funding medical research in the United Kingdom.\nNational Health and Medical Research Council, Australia's peak funding body for medical research\nSouth African Medical Research Council, a state medical research organization in South Africa\n\nPage: Rockefeller University\nSummary: The Rockefeller University is a private biomedical research and graduate-only university in New York City, New York.

Lifton became the university's eleventh president on September 1, 2016. The Rockefeller University Press publishes the Journal of Experimental Medicine, the Journal of Cell Biology, and The Journal of General Physiology.\nIn 2018, the faculty included 82 tenured and tenure-track members, including 37 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 17 members of the National Academy of Medicine, seven Lasker Award recipients, and five Nobel laureates.

It is used in many cuisines around the world for its soft, delicate and sweet flavor. Crab meat is low in fat and provides approximately 340 kilojoules (82 kcal) of food energy per 85-gram (3 oz) serving. Brown crab (Cancer pagurus), blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), blue swimming crabs (Portunus pelagicus), and red swimming crabs (Portunus haanii) are among the most commercially available species of crabmeat globally. \nIn some fisheries, crab meat is harvested by declawing of crabs. This is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs.\n\nPage: Crab stick\nSummary: Crab sticks, krab sticks, snow legs, imitation crab meat, or seafood sticks are a Japanese seafood product made of surimi (pulverized white fish) and starch, then shaped and cured to resemble the leg meat of snow crab or Japanese spider crab. It is a product that uses fish meat to imitate shellfish meat. \nIn Japanese, it is called kanikama (\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30de), a portmanteau of kani (\"crab\") and kamaboko (\"fish cake\"). In the United States, it is often simply called kani.\n\n\n\nPage: Crab\nSummary: Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura (meaning \"short tail\" in Greek), which typically have a very short projecting tail-like abdomen, usually hidden entirely under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land. They are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton. They generally have five pairs of legs, and they have pincer claws on the ends of the frontmost pair. They first appeared during the Jurassic period, around 200 million years ago."]]}], "tool_execution_list": [], "prediction": "$1.8"}

They will serve as USA Track & Field's (USATF) national championships in track and field for the United States. The results of the event will determine qualification for the September 13\u201321 2025 World Athletics Championships, held in Tokyo, Japan. Provided they achieved the World standard or are in the World Athletics ranking quota, the top two athletes in each event will gain a place on the Team USA World team. In the event that a leading athlete does not hold the standard (or an athlete withdraws) the next-highest-finishing athlete with the standard will be selected instead. USATF is expected to announce their World Championship roster based on these guidelines in August 2025.\n\nPage: Teamwork\nSummary: Teamwork is the collaborative effort of a group to achieve a common goal or to complete a task in an effective and efficient way. Teamwork is seen within the framework of a team, which is a group of interdependent individuals who work together towards a common goal.\nThe four key characteristics of a team include a shared goal, interdependence, boundedness, stability, the ability to manage their own work and internal process, and operate in a bigger social system.\nTeams need to be able to leverage resources to be productive (i.e. playing fields or meeting spaces, scheduled times for planning, guidance from coaches or supervisors, support from the organization, etc.), and clearly defined roles within the team in order for everyone to have a clear purpose. Teamwork is present in contexts including an industrial organization (formal work teams), athletics (sports teams), a school (classmates working on a project), and the healthcare system (operating room teams). In each of these settings, the level of teamwork and interdependence can vary from low (e.g. golf, track and field), to intermediate (e.g. baseball, football), to high (e.g. basketball, soccer), depending on the amount of communication, interaction, and collaboration present between team members.\nAmong the requirements for effective teamwork are an adequate team size. The context is important, and team sizes can vary depending upon the objective. A team must include at least two members, and most teams range in size from two to 100. Sports teams generally have fixed sizes based upon set rules, and work teams may change in size depending upon the phase and complexity of the objective.\n\n\n\nPage: Short-track speed skating\nSummary: Short-track speed skating is a form of competitive ice speed skating. In competitions, multiple skaters (typically between four and six) skate on an oval ice track with a length of 111.111 metres (364.54 ft). The rink itself is 60 metres (196.85 ft) long by 30 metres (98.43 ft) wide, which is the same size as an Olympic-sized figure skating rink and an international-sized ice hockey rink. Related sports include long-track speed skating and inline speed skating."]]}, {"step": " Count all the team sizes identified (32, 32, 35, 38, 49, 50, 54, 54, 62, 66, 70, 71, 73, 75, 83, 84) that are at least 27 members.

In addition, three TV movies aired before the regular series premiered and four specials and a TV movie aired after the series ended. The series was set on the cruise ship MS Pacific Princess, and revolved around the ship's captain Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin MacLeod) and a handful of his crew, with passengers played by guest actors for each episode, having romantic, dramatic and humorous adventures.\nThe series was part of ABC's popular Saturday-night lineup of the time, which also included Fantasy Island until 1984. The executive producer for the series was Aaron Spelling, who produced several television series for Four Star Television and ABC from the 1960s into the 1990s.\nThe series was nominated four consecutive times for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy between 1978 and 1981, without winning any. Gavin MacLeod and Lauren Tewes also received several Golden Globe nominations for their roles in the series. In 1997, the episode with segment titles \"Hidden Treasure\", \"Picture from the Past\", and \"Ace's Salary\" (season 9, episode 3) was ranked No. 82 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.\n\n\n\nPage: Fresh Off the Boat\nSummary: Fresh Off the Boat is an American television sitcom created by Nahnatchka Khan and produced by 20th Century Fox Television for ABC. It is loosely inspired by the life of chef and food personality Eddie Huang and his 2013 autobiography of the same name. Huang also executive produced the series and narrated its first season. Depicting the life of a Taiwanese-American family in Florida in the 1990s, the series stars Randall Park, Constance Wu, Hudson Yang, Forrest Wheeler, Ian Chen, and Lucille Soong as the Huang family as well as Chelsey Crisp and Ray Wise portraying the family's next-door neighbors.\nThe series premiered its first two episodes on ABC in February 2015 to positive critical reception, becoming the first network television sitcom in the U.S. to feature a family of Asian Americans as main characters in over 20 years. Prior to its second season, the series went through a retooling, which included Huang's departure as narrator. It received accolades as well as nominations for major awards, such as Critics' Choice Television Award and NAACP Image Award nominations. After becoming the first series featuring an all-Asian American main cast to broadcast over 100 episodes, the series concluded on February 21, 2020, after six seasons.\n\n\n\nPage: Carnival World Tour\nSummary: The Carnival World Tour (Chinese: \u5609\u5e74\u83ef\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u8ff4\u6f14\u5531\u6703) is the eighth concert tour by Taiwanese recording artist Jay Chou.
