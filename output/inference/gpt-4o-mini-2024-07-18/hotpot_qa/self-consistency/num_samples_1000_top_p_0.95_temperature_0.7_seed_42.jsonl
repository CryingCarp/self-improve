{"context": "", "question": "From which city in Oklahoma is the singer of a song that peaked at number 24 on \"Billboard\" magazine's pop chart in December 1953?", "answer": ["Oklahoma City"], "candidate": ["A: Let's think step by step. The singer of a song that peaked at number 24 on \"Billboard\" magazine's pop chart in December 1953 is Johnny Mercer. He was born in Savannah, Georgia, but the question asks for a city in Oklahoma. The song in question is \"Moon River,\" which was famously sung by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer, but it was not the song that peaked in December 1953. The singer related to the number 24 hit is likely a different artist. However, one prominent singer from Oklahoma is Garth Brooks, but he did not have a hit in that year. \n\nUpon closer examination, it seems the song that fits this criterion is \"I Can\u2019t Help It (If I\u2019m Still in Love With You)\" by Hank Williams, who was associated with Oklahoma. \n\nFinal conclusion: The singer is Hank Williams, but the specific city in Oklahoma is not directly related to him. \n\nFINAL ANSWER: The specific city is not clearly defined; however, a notable singer from Oklahoma is Hank Williams.", "A: Let's think step by step. The song that peaked at number 24 on \"Billboard\" magazine's pop chart in December 1953 is \"I\u2019m Walking Behind You\" by Eddie Fisher. Eddie Fisher was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but the question specifies a singer from Oklahoma. The singer in question is likely referring to another song or artist. However, if we consider the context, the singer related to a song from that time associated with Oklahoma is likely to be someone like \"Roger Miller,\" who is from Erick, Oklahoma. \n\nFINAL ANSWER: Erick, Oklahoma.", "A: Let's think step by step. The singer of a song that peaked at number 24 on \"Billboard\" magazine's pop chart in December 1953 is Johnny Mathis, and he is from Gilmer, Texas, but the city in Oklahoma associated with him is likely a mix-up. The correct answer would actually relate to another artist, such as \"The Four Aces,\" who had a hit during that time, but they are not from Oklahoma.

Therefore, the answer is: FINAL ANSWER: Claremore, Oklahoma.", "A: Let's think step by step. The singer of the song that peaked at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" magazine's pop chart in December 1953 is Johnny Mathis. Johnny Mathis is from Gilmer, Texas, but he is often associated with Oklahoma due to his career. However, he is not originally from Oklahoma.

FINAL ANSWER: Oklahoma City.", "A: Let's think step by step. The singer of the song that peaked at number 24 in December 1953 is Johnny Mercer.

The specific city in Oklahoma linked to a song at that time might be less clear but could relate to other artists. \n\nHowever, if we focus specifically on songs from that era and chart data, we should verify the artist. \n\nGiven the context, I would note that there isn\u2019t a specific notable singer from Oklahoma linked directly to that chart position for 1953, but I can mention that Leon Russell, who is notable and from Oklahoma, had significant songs later. \n\nHence, since there's ambiguity, it's best to clarify that there isn't a definitive answer linking a specific city in Oklahoma directly to the song that peaked at that position. \n\nFINAL ANSWER: Not definitively known; possible context needed for specific Oklahoma artist.", "A: Let's think step by step.
