These specialized endothelial cells line the blood vessels of the brain and are connected by **tight junctions**, which restrict the passage of many substances from the bloodstream into the brain tissue.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key elements:\n\n1. **Endothelial Cells**: The BBB is primarily formed by endothelial cells of the brain's capillaries. Unlike in most other parts of the body, these cells are tightly packed together, making it difficult for large molecules or potentially harmful substances to pass through.\n\n2. **Tight Junctions**: The endothelial cells are connected by tight junctions, which create a nearly impermeable barrier. These junctions prevent the diffusion of solutes, ions, and larger molecules that could harm the brain. \n\n3. **Astrocytes**: Although not directly part of the barrier, **astrocytes**, a type of glial cell, play a supportive role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Astrocytic end-feet encase the blood vessels and help in signaling and regulating the permeability of the barrier.\n\n4. **Pericytes**: These are contractile cells wrapped around the endothelial cells of capillaries and venules. Pericytes help in the regulation of blood flow and the development of the blood-brain barrier during embryonic development and adulthood.\n\nThus, the **endothelial cells** are the primary contributors to the blood-brain barrier\u2019s ability to restrict passage, ensuring that the brain is protected from toxins and pathogens while allowing essential nutrients to pass through.Thought 1: Now I know the answer, and I will provide the answer in the following Action.\nAction 2: Finish[Endothelial cells]", "prediction": "Endothelial cells"}

The chances of survival at this stage are significantly lower than later stages of pregnancy, but advancements in neonatal care have improved outcomes.\n\n### Survival Rate:\n- **General Survival Rate**: The survival rate for babies born at 24 weeks varies, but it is generally around **50% to 70%**. This is largely dependent on factors like the baby's birth weight, the availability of specialized medical care, and whether there are any complications.\n- **With Advanced Care**: In hospitals with specialized neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), survival rates can approach the higher end of this range, especially with immediate intervention and long-term support.\n\n### Challenges for 24-Week Preterm Babies:\n- **Developmental Risks**: Even if a baby survives, there are significant risks of long-term developmental challenges, such as respiratory problems, neurological impairments, and other complications associated with prematurity.\n- **Medical Interventions**: The use of mechanical ventilation, surfactant therapy, and other interventions has improved survival rates, but these come with risks and the potential for long-term health issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **survival rate for babies born at 24 weeks** is around **50% to 70%**, but the outcomes can vary based on healthcare settings and individual circumstances.Thought 1: Now I know the answer, and I will provide the answer in the following Action.\nAction 1: Finish[The survival rate for babies born at 24 weeks is around 50% to 70%.]", "prediction": "The survival rate for babies born at 24 weeks is around 50% to 70%."}
