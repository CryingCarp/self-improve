Therefore, there are 4 bins with exactly 43 toys. FINAL ANSWER: 4", "Answer: Look for the stem that represents the tens place of 43. The tens place is 4, so we will look at the stem \"4\". The leaf values corresponding to this stem are 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, and 8. \n\nTo find the total number of toys represented by this stem and leaf, we combine the stem with each leaf. For the stem \"4\":\n\n- Leaf 3 corresponds to 43\n- Leaf 3 corresponds to 43\n- Leaf 3 corresponds to 43\n- Leaf 3 corresponds to 43\n- Leaf 7 corresponds to 47\n- Leaf 8 corresponds to 48\n\nThus, there are four leaves (3s) that correspond to 43 toys.\n\nThe number of bins with exactly 43 toys is 4.
