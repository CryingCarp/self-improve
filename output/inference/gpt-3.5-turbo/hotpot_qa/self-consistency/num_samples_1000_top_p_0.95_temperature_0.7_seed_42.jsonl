The \"value premium\" is the phenomenon where stocks with lower prices relative to fundamental measures of value (such as earnings or book value) tend to have higher returns over the long run than stocks with higher prices relative to those same measures. An expert who argues that no value premium exists is likely arguing that there is no empirical evidence to support the idea that value stocks outperform growth stocks over the long run. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as changes in the market or the fact that the value premium has been arbitraged away by investors seeking higher returns. FINAL ANSWER: The expert found that there is no empirical evidence to support the idea that value stocks outperform growth stocks over the long run.", "A: Let's think step by step. The value premium is a financial concept that suggests that value stocks (those with low prices relative to their fundamentals) tend to outperform growth stocks (those with high prices relative to their fundamentals).

The value premium is a financial concept that suggests that stocks with lower prices relative to their fundamental value tend to outperform stocks with higher prices relative to their fundamental value over time. Some experts have argued that the value premium does not exist or has disappeared in recent years. So, the expert who argued that no value premium exists would have found that there is no evidence of stocks with lower prices relative to their fundamental value outperforming stocks with higher prices relative to their fundamental value over time.

The value premium is the supposed higher return that investors receive from investing in stocks that have lower prices relative to their fundamental value (value stocks) compared to stocks that have higher prices relative to their fundamental value (growth stocks). The expert who argued that no value premium exists is Eugene Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist. He found that while value stocks have historically outperformed growth stocks, this outperformance can be explained by the higher risk associated with investing in value stocks.
