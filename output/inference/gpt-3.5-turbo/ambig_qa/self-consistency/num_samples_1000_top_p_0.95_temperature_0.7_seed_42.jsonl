The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are considered the \"supreme law of the land\" under the Constitution, and are thus enacted law. However, the decisions of the Supreme Court also serve as precedent, which can be used to guide future court decisions, and thus contribute to the development of common law.

A decision of the US Supreme Court is considered a precedent that can be used as a basis for future decisions in similar cases. This is known as common law. However, Supreme Court decisions can also have an impact on enacted law if they declare a law unconstitutional, resulting in the law being struck down. FINAL ANSWER: Both common law and enacted law", "A: A decision of the US Supreme Court can be considered both an enacted law and a common law. It is an enacted law because once the Supreme Court makes a decision, it becomes a precedent that must be followed by lower courts in similar cases. At the same time, it is considered a common law because it is a legal principle that is developed and refined over time based on the decisions made by the courts.

So, the sale of beer became legal again in Wisconsin on April 25, 1933. FINAL ANSWER: April 25, 1933.", "A: Let's think step by step.

So, beer sales were prohibited in Wisconsin between 1920 and 1933. FINAL ANSWER: 1920", "A: Let's think step by step. Wisconsin did not wait for Prohibition to end.

Wisconsin did not wait until the national prohibition to go dry. Wisconsin became the first state to ratify the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on May 13, 1919, which means that the sale and manufacture of alcohol were banned in the state a year before national prohibition began in 1920. FINAL ANSWER: 1919", "A: Let's think step by step. Wisconsin was the first state in the US to reinstate legal beer sales after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.

However, the law went into effect on July 1, 1919, several months before the ratification of the 18th Amendment that established national prohibition.
