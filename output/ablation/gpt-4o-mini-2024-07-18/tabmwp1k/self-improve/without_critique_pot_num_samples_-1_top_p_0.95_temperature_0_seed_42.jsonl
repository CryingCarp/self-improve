Make sure to recognize that 'Stem' represents tens and 'Leaf' represents units.\n\nStep 2: Identify the bags that have 54 or more candies based on the stem-and-leaf plot. \n- The relevant 'Stems' for numbers 54 and above are 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. \n- Specifically, look for 'Leaves' associated with these 'Stems' that will give numbers equal to or greater than 54 (i.e., 52, 60, 70, 80, 90).\n\nError-prone point: Overlooking any of the relevant stems when looking for counts could result in missing some bags.

Count: 1 bag.\n- For stem 7, the leaves are 3 and 9 (73, 79); both meet the criterion. Count: 2 bags.\n- For stem 8, the leaves are 4, 4, and 9 (84, 84, 89); all meet the criterion. Count: 3 bags.\n- For stem 9, the leaf is 0 (90); it meets the criterion. Count: 1 bag.\n\nError-prone point: Miscounting the total number of bags could occur here. Maintain a running total and double-check each count against the relevant criteria to ensure accuracy.\n\nStep 4: Sum the total counts of the bags that had 54 or more lemon-flavored candies.\n- Total from stem 6: 1 bag\n- Total from stem 7: 2 bags\n- Total from stem 8: 3 bags\n- Total from stem 9: 1 bag \n- Add them up: 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7 bags.\n\nError-prone point: Ensure accurate addition of all the counts. Mistakes can happen in summation, so it's essential to verify each step in the addition process.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the answer based on the summed total.\n- Clearly state that the total number of bags with at least 54 lemon-flavored candies is 7.\n\nError-prone point: Failure to present the conclusion clearly or stating the wrong total could lead to confusion.
